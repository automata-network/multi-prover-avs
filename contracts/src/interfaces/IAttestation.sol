 * @title Interface standard that implement attestation contracts whose verification logic can be implemented
 * both on-chain and with Risc0 ZK proofs
 * @notice The interface simply provides two verification methods for a given attestation input.
 * The user can either pay a possibly hefty gas cost to fully verify an attestation fully on-chain
 * OR
 * Provides ZK proofs from executing an off-chain program where the verification of such attestation is conducted.
 * @dev should also implement Risc0 Guest Program to use this interface.
